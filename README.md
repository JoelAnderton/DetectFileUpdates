# DetectFileUpdates
To detect all file updates or additions in a given folder and its subfolders compared to the last time the program was run

# What I Learned
* Learned how to compare the contents of both keys and values between 2 dictionaries.
* Learned that when the file path is greater than 255 characters, Python no longer believes the files exists. The work around is to add u'\\\\\\\\?\\\\' to the beginning of the file path.
* Practiced using "pickle" to save the list of dictionaries so they can be compared at a later date.
